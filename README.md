- Checked types of data

### **2. Find appropriate questions**
To gain insights from the data, i chose questions like:

#### **Hosts**
- Which host has the most offers?
- What is the average number of offers per host?

#### **Locations**
- Which neighbourhood_group has the most offers?
- Which specific neighbourhood has the most offers?

#### **Room Types**
- Which room type has the most offers?
- Which room type is the most expensive when grouped by neighbourhood and room type?

#### **Prices**
- What is the average price per night in each specific neighbourhood?
- What is the average minimum number of nights required in each specific neighbourhood?
- How does the average price per night compare to the average minimum nights required?

#### **Availability and Reviews**
- Where were the most offers available for 365 days in a year?
- What is the average availability of offers?

  - What is the average number of offers per host?
- **Insights**:
  - The host with the most listings has X offers, significantly above the average of Y offers per host.
  - This indicates that some hosts dominate the market, potentially suggesting a business opportunity or challenge for smaller hosts.
